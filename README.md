# In this project, let's build a Customer Churn Predictor.

- Customer churn is a situation where the customers who have subscribed to a particular service tend to unsubscribe from it, and this could happen due to various reasons.

- Now, we have a dataset with us, named `internet_service_churn.csv` which has various details about different users who have subscribed to a internet service provider. The users have all at some point subscribed to the service, and some have already churned from the service, while some still have a subscription in the service.

- The dataset also contains different features of the user which could help our prediction model in understanding why someone has churned and why some other has not. Going ahead, we will try to build different models on this data, and then we'll further work on the model that gives us the best accuracy. We will also try to improve that model.
